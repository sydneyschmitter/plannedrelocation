# Planned Relocation Geospatial Analysis
A geospatial analysis of 17 planned relocation cases around the globe.

The planned, permanent relocation of entire communities away from areas facing sea level rise (SLR) and coastal floods is an increasingly recognized strategy for climate change adaptation. Yet, planned relocations may or may not reduce risk. We assess projections of future coastal flooding in all the completed or underway relocations that met our criteria for inclusion from a global dataset. Most of the 17 cases achieved exposure reduction with less future inundation in destinations than origin sites, but the extent varies across time and emissions scenario. In all cases, origin sites are projected to be exposed to SLR combined with a once-per-year flooding event. In nine cases, even destination sites are projected to be exposed to SLR plus a once-a-year flooding event under some scenarios. Small island-to-small island relocations had more projected inundation in destinations than moves from a small island-to-mainland, or from mainland-to-mainland.

The 17 coastal planned relocation cases analyzed span the Pacific, South and Southeast Asia, and North, South, and Central America. Most cases are in island nations (e.g., Fiji, Maldives) and in the USA. Eleven cases are completed while six are ongoing. While we assessed exposure to SLR and flooding, other coastal hazards such as storm hazards (e.g., wind and rain), erosion, saltwater intrusion, wetland loss, and tsunamis also informed actual relocation decisions. 

Geospatial data for the 17 planned relocation cases is available in this repository as .shp files for the following sites:

United States of America: Taholah, La Push, Isle de Jean Charles; Colombia: El Choncho; Panama: Gardi Sugdub; Brazil: Enseada de Balleja; Maldives: Kandholhudhoo, Gemendhoo, Madifushi; Sri Lanka: Talalla; Indonesia: Jakarta, Saney; Fiji: Vunidogoloa, Denimanu, Vunisavisavi, Narikoso; Solomon Islands: Mondo
